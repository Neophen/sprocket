                    Welcome to the official documentation of Sprocket, a real-time server-side components framework for Gleam! In this guide, we'll
                    cover the core concepts of Sprocket, but some prerequisite knowledge of Gleam is recommended. Gleam is a type-safe functional language designed
                    to harness the power of the Erlang Beam virtual machine. Whether you are a seasoned Gleam enthusiast or new to this exciting language,
                    this documentation will serve as your roadmap to building highly scalable, robust, and efficient server-side components.

                      Sprocket was born out of a vision to bridge the gap between functional programming, type-safety, and the real-time demands of modern
                      applications. With Sprocket, developers can seamlessly construct concurrent and distributed systems without compromising on the rigor
                      of Gleam's static typing. By leveraging the Erlang Beam VM, Sprocket enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time communication
                      channels that cater to the needs of modern web applications, IoT devices, and more.
